## Introduction

The multi-access key to flowering plant families of Victoria is a starting point to identify an unknown flowering plant to family level. From the family profile page, the user can check the general family description matches their plant, look through photos of a selection of species in that family, and then use more specific keys on that page to get to genus and then species rank. This multi-access key can be used for any of the c. 4,200 native or naturalised flowering plant species in Victoria. Due to their quite distinctive morphological features that are not found in flowering plants, and the relatively small number of species, non-flowering vascular plants (e.g. conifers and ferns) are not included in this key.
This key has been designed for people with limited botanical knowledge and as much as reasonably possible uses simple language, includes some readily observed characters (e.g. flower colour, petal number), and avoids highly technical features (e.g. ovule placentation, anther dehiscence etc.). Furthermore, where possible, it allows for commonly misinterpreted characters to be ‘incorrectly’ scored, meaning the correct family will not be discarded due to the selection of a technically incorrect character state. By lacking some of the more highly technical characters and the allowance of character misinterpretation this key has become less powerful, and it may be difficult to get down to a single family. However, for users that find traditional dichotomous keys daunting, the benefits of having a less powerful key is viewed as more desirable than having a more powerful key that will be prone to remove the correct answer due to the users technical misunderstanding. Likewise, users who have a specimen that lacks all features required to move through a dichotomous may find this useful to narrow down possible options. It is hoped that most users will find having half a dozen or so plant families to investigate after entering a few basic characters into this key to be a good starting point for finding their plant in this vast resource.  
This multi-access key differs from the other (dichotomous) keys provided in VicFlora by giving the user the flexibility to choose from one of the 70 characters provided rather than the user having to commit to investigate the particular features being questioned in the dichotomous keys. This has the benefit of avoiding having to answer questions relating to a feature that may not be present in the sample when being identified, and potentially being able to identify a taxon without needing to include some of the most technical features. This key includes a range of features including detailed leaf, flower and fruit characters. As such this key may prove helpful in the identification of sterile or incomplete specimens.
To use the key the user selects a feature from the features in the top left Features Available panel and clicks on the state present in their specimen to be identified. Once selected this feature and state will show as being selected in the Features Chosen panel directly below the Features Available panel. To undo a selection, click on the box next to the state chosen in the Features Chosen panel to erase the tick in the box. Once a feature state is chosen all the taxa that do not possess the chosen feature state are discarded in the bottom right Entities Discarded panel and those that do possess the chosen are retained in the top right Entities Remaining panel. The user continues to choose further character states present in their specimen until identification is achieved. To restart the key when finished select the restart key icon represented by the two green arrows in the top left corner of the screen.

## General helpful hints

For the most effective use of this key the user is encouraged to read the help guides for each character and state before submitting an answer for that character and state. Help guides and photographs can be found by clicking on the page icons beside characters and states. This help will reduce the chance of misinterpretation of the character and state. Some information and definitions required for interpreting a state may be given under character so users are encouraged to read the help guide for the characters before the states. When taking measurements or assessing which state a character exists in for the taxon being identified a typical plant and plant part should be used. Typical is here interpreted as a close representation of the average plant in terms of size and stature in a population and a plant part that represents the average condition for that character (e.g. average length, the most frequently observed density of hairs etc. For some of the characters it is possible for some taxa to possess more than one character state for the character. In such cases either correct character state can be chosen.
To help identify the specimen to be identified as quickly as possible the best option can be used. This option highlights which charaters should be used first to discard the maximum number of taxa among the remaining taxa. To use the best option select the best icon given as a blue wand at the top of the screen. For some similar taxa such as closely related species or subspecies within a species it may become time consuming to keep using the key until one taxon remains. In such instances the user can use the dichotomous keys and profiles to help to distinguish between similar species.

## Lifeform

### Habit

General growth form of the plant. This character has eight states which are not always exclusive (e.g. scrambling plants may also be treated as herbs or shrubs).

- #### Tree

  Plant that are typically over 3 meters tall with woody stems (often only one main stem) and woody branches.

- #### Shrub

  Perennial plant usually up to c. 5 m tall with woody stems and branches but usually lacking a single main trunk. The boundary between tree and shrub may not always be clear.

- #### Vine

  Plant with woody or herbaceous, flexible stems that climbs over other vegetation to support its growth, extending considerable heights into the tree canopy.

- #### Scrambler

  Plant with long stems that vertically grow through and often over other vegetation but usually does not extend to great heights into tree canopies.

- #### Palm

  Perennial plant usually with a single unbranched woody stem with palm- or fan-shaped leaves that are formed in a tuft at the top of the stem (e.g. Palm trees). Stems lack bark and are formed by persistent leaf bases. Only one family, Arecaceae.

- #### Subshrub

  Perennial or annual plant with a woody rootstock and partially woody stems but generally with herbaceous branches. Similar to but generally smaller than a shrub.

- #### Herb

  Perennial or annual plant that does not produce woody stems. These are often quite short plants that are soft in texture.

- #### Grass/grass-like

  Annual or perennial plants with strap-like leaves, often formed in tufts (e.g. grasses, sedges, rushes. But expanded here to include some grass-like lilies and irises). When present, stems are generally non-woody and often prostrate, replaced by belowground rhizomes, or specialised into morphologically distinct stems that produce reproductive organs (i.e. scape).

### Classification

Flowering plants are generally classified into monocots and dicots, that is, those that produce one (=monocot) or two (=dicot) cotyledon(s). With a cotyledon being the first leaf (or leaves when two are produced) from the seed. Aside from this rarely observed cotyledon feature, the two groups may generally be distinguished by a range of other features displayed in adult plants. These are outlined below. If unsure it is best to skip this character.

- #### Monocot

  Plants generally have leaves that are strap-like or borne on very long stalks, leaves have parallel veins, flowers have parts (petals, sepals, anthers etc.) in 3’s or 6’s (rarely 2’s or 4’s), roots are fibrous, and the embryo has 1 cotyledon. Includes grasses, rushes, sedges, lilies, orchids, palms, and some vines.

- #### Dicot

  Plants often have leaves with net-like veins, flowers usually have parts (petals, sepals, anthers etc.) in 4’s or 5’s (but rarely 3’s, 6’s or more), roots form a taproot (at least when young), and the embryo has 2 cotyledons. Includes herbs and most plants with secondary woody growth (trees, and shrubs).

### Habitat

The type of environment in which the plant is growing. This character has three states.

- #### Terrestrial or aerial

  Plants that occur on land or grow on other plants. This includes areas that are occasionally submerged in water (typically shallow pools etc.), but not permanently under water. It also includes plants that are attached to other plants, either as epiphytes or aerial parasites (to specify your plant is parasitic see Nutrient uptake below).

- #### Submerged aquatic

  Plants which grow in water, and that are rooted in the ground below. Includes both marine and fresh-water environments. Leaves and flowers may be fully submerged, floating at the surface or emergent.

- #### Floating aquatic

  Plants that float in or on the water’s surface but are not attached to a substrate. Roots are either apparently lacking or left dangling in water.

### Nutrient uptake

The manner in which the plant obtains nutrients.

#### Nutrient source

The means in which the plant obtains nutrients. Plants are here divided into two groups, those that produce their own nutrients (via photosynthesis) and those that derive nutrients from parasitising other sources (consumers).

- ##### Producer

  Plants that produce their own nutrients (via photosynthesis). These are typically green plants with leaves.

- ##### Consumer

  Plants that derive nutrients from other sources, either through parasitising other plants or other lifeforms (see Parasitic plants below). These plants may also have the capacity to photosynthesize but supplement this through these other sources. Plants are often not green and, in many cases, produce very reduced or no leaves.

#### Parasitic plants

The method employed by a parasitic plant to obtain nutrition. This character has three states.

- ##### Stem parasite

  Plants that are attached to and draw nutrients from the stems or other aerial parts of another plant. Such plants will typically grow over the top of the host plant.

- ##### Root parasite

  Plants that are attached to and draw nutrients from the roots of other plants. Such plants grow in close proximity to the host but are usually not joined to any of its above-ground parts.

- ##### Carnivorous plant

  Plants obtain nutrients by trapping and consuming living animals or microbes. These tend to occur in nutrient poor environments (e.g. boggy sites) and use this method to supplement nutrient derived from photosynthesis (rather than replacing it altogether). As such these are usually green plants, but usually have modified leaves that exude sticky substances or employ other methods to ‘trap’ prey.

## Root

### Root type

The main root structures formed. This character has four states.

- #### Taproot/network

  The most common root structure of most plants. These lack any specialised underground structures, other than the typical root network (ie. a main root (or few roots) from which smaller roots may then branch off from. These are sometimes fibrous, particularly in monocot species.

- #### Rhizome/stolon

  Plants with often long, usually lateral main roots from which new shoots emerge. These long stem-like roots may either be below ground (rhizomes) or run along the surface where they are often sheltered by surrounding vegetation or litter (stolons).

- #### Bulb/corm

  A storage structure usually held underground or near the surface formed by the stem, from the top of which new above-ground growth is derived (from buds). These are often swollen and spherical or ovoid.

- #### Tuber

  A swollen below ground storage structure formed by a stem or root which either does not produce buds or produces buds from various points throughout the structure (e.g. a potato). These are often cylindrical or irregularly shaped.

## Indumentum

### Indumentum types

Hair and other coverings occurring on stems and leaves. While all parts of a plant may possess indumentum, this character is here restricted to vegetative parts (stems and leaves) as these features are readily observed. This character has ten states.

- #### Simple hairs

  Hairs that are unbranched or have glands or any other feature. These may be unicellular or multicellular, straight or curved, held erect or against the surface.

- #### Stiff/bristle/hispid

  Hairs that stiff, ridged, hard or flexible, sometimes with a sharp point. These are often straight, but can be curved or have a bend.

- #### Tuberculate/scabrid

  Plants with a covering of warty outgrowths. These are often hardened and may be quite sharp or rough to touch.

- #### Forked/centifixed/peltate

  Hairs or scales with a central stalk (sometimes this is very short) which is then branched into two arms or attached to the centre a flattened shield-like structure (peltate). When branches are long and flat, these may appear like hairs that are not attached to a surface. Likewise, peltate hairs may appear like scales sitting on top of a surface. These may sometimes be very dense and obscure the surface below. Hairs that are branched with multiple arms (>2) are classified as branched.

- #### Branched hairs

  Hairs that have several branches or arms. These branches may all rise from a central point and spread outwards like a star (stellate) or involve multiple branches at various points along a main stem, a bit like a tree (dendritic). These may sometimes be very dense and obscure the surface below.

- #### Woolly/cottony/silky hairs

  Surfaces with a dense covering of simple, often long, thick, wavy or curved hairs that largely obscure the surface below and give a scruffy, cottony, silky, cobwebbed or woolly appearance. Other character states forked/centifixed/peltate and branched may also obscure the surface but are comprised of more complex, branched hairs.

- #### Glandular hairs/sessile glands

  Hairs that end in a gland or surfaces that have glands. Glands usually appear as a spherical structure which is often coloured or clear. Sometimes surfaces become covered in a viscid liquid exuded from these glands, giving it an overall sticky texture.

- #### Bladder-hairs

  Modified surface cells that are swollen and hollow, these are typically developed to accumulate salt. These eventually burst, giving the surface a mealy or silvery appearance. Particularly common in Chenopodiaceae and Aizoaceae.

- #### Stinging hairs

  Hairs filled with an irritant liquid that are painful to touch. Only found in some species of Urticaceae.

- #### Glabrous

  Surfaces without hairs or other coverings.

## Stem

### Stem spines

Hard rigid spines on a stem. Such spines are generally sharp and painful to touch. This character has two states.

- #### Spines present

  The stem bears hard ridged spines that are generally sharp and painful to touch. These may occur along the stem or the stem may terminate in a hard spine.

- #### Spines absent

  The stem does not bear hard ridged spines.

## Sap

### Sap type

Fluid inside the plant which is secreted when the stems or other organs are damaged or cut. In some species this has a very high latex content and appears ‘milky’. This character has two states.

- #### Not milky

  Sap usually clear or occasionally coloured (often appearing green), but not white and milky.

- #### Milky

Sap white and ‘milky’, often quite thick.

## Leaf

### Leaf type

The general form of the leaf, including the presence/absence or specialised modification of leaves. This character has five states.

- #### Simple leaves

  A leaf that is not divided into leaflets. This is the most commonly encountered leaf type, it consists of a single leaf blade, often with a stalk (petiole) or attached directly onto the stem. Simple leaves may be deeply dissected into lobes (pinnatisect) but are still regarded as simple as there is one continuous leaf blade (at least along the mid-vein). See leaf margins below to indicate dissection of the leaf blade.

- #### Compound leaves

  A leaf that is divided into leaflets. These are often borne on a shared stalk (petiole) which has several small leaflets. Leaflets are often opposite or arise in groups of 3 or 5. In some species these may be divided 2 (bipinnate) or 3 (tripinnate) or more times. See leaflet number below to indicate the number of leaflets on your sample.

- #### Leaves absent

  Leaves not produced. Stems are usually green and photosynthetic.

- #### Phyllode

  True leaves absent but replaced by laterally flattened photosynthetic (or sometimes terete) blade apparently derived from an expanded petiole and rachis. Present in some species of Fabaceae, especially _Acacia_.

- #### Scales/spines/thallus/leaf sheath only

  Leaves are reduced to scales, spines, leaf sheath or a thallus (small green structure not clearly defined into stem or leaf – e.g. _Lemna_).

### Leaflet number

When leaves are compound and consist of more than 2 leaflets the number present can be recorded here. For pinnae that are divided more than once (i.e. bipinnate or tripinnate), count the total number of pinnules. This character has eight states.

### Leaf length

The general length of the leaf. This will generally vary considerably within a family, as such, this character has five very broad states to generally indicate if the leaf is very small, small, large, very large etc. To avoid confusion around leaves vs leaflets and petioles and attenuate leaf bases, lengths may be taken of entire leaves (e.g. the leaf blade/leaflets and petiole) or just the leaflet/leaf blade.

### Leaf blade margin

The degree of dissection (eg. lobes/teeth etc.) along the leaf margin. This character has four states.

- #### Entire/undulate

  Leaves that are completely intact along the edge without any incisions or teeth. Margins may be somewhat wavy or undulating.

- #### Minute teeth

  Leaves with sharp, rasping or cutting leaf margins due to the presence of numerous, small often barely visible teeth or sharp swellings (e.g. sward-grass).

- #### Lobed/toothed

  Leaves with sharp or rounded teeth or lobes along the margins that are incised up to about half of the way to the mid-vein.

- #### Pinnatifid/pinnatisect

  Leaves that have segments that are formed by an incision of at least half of the way to the mid-vein. Lobes may be formed along the entire leaf margin or all radiate from a central point near the leaf base (palmatisect).

### Leaf arrangement

How the leaves are arranged on the plant. This character has five states.

- #### Alternate

  Leaves that are borne at slightly different levels along a stem.

- #### Opposite

  Leaves that are borne in pairs directly opposite one another on the stem.

- #### Whorl

  Three or more leaves that are borne at the same level in a circle around the stem.

- #### Basal/rosette

  Plants with all leaves clustered together at ground level at the base of any aerial stems.

### Leaf upper surface indument

- #### Upper surface glabrous

  Without hairs or other coverings.

- #### Upper surface glabrescent

  With only very few hairs present, or becoming glabrous (without hair).

- #### Upper surface viscid

  Sticky surface due to the excretion of resin or oil etc. This can be evenly distributed across the surface or consist of scattered to numerous droplets (from glands). These oils may often turn black on drying.

- #### Upper surface hairy

  Surface with scattered to dense hairs.

### Leaf upper surface colour

The colour of the upper surface of the leaf. This character has five states.

### Leaf lower surface indument

Covering(s) present on the on the upper leaf surface. This character has three states.

- #### Lower surface glabrous/glabrescent

### Leaf texture

The overall texture of leaves. Includes three character states.

- #### Fleshy/succulent

  Swollen, juicy often soft and thick-textured leaves with a high moisture content. Particularly common in arid or saline environments.

- #### Herbaceous/chartaceous

  Typical leaf, thin, soft to firm but flexible.

- #### Tough/ericoid

  Thick, tough, hardened leaves, sometimes much reduced in size.

### Leaf attachment

The manner in which the leaf is attached to the stem. This character has three states.

- #### Basal petiole

  Leaves attached to the stem by a stalk (petiole) at the base of the leaf. In some cases the petiole may only be a few millimetres long.

- #### Sessile/subsessile

  Leaves attached directly to the stem without any connecting stalk (petiole), or with a minute stalk (c. <0.5 mm long). In some cases the leaf may clasp or even completely encircle the stem.

- #### Peltate

  Leaves that are attached to the stem by a stalk (petiole) that is attached near the centre of the blade (rather than the margin).

### Leaf blade base

The shape of the base of the leaf (or leaflet) blade. This character has three states.

- #### Wedge-shaped/obtuse/rounded

  Leaves with blades that taper, curve downward or are rounded at the base.

  Leaf that bears hard ridged spines that are generally sharp and painful to touch. These often occur at the tip of the leaf.

- #### Spines absent

  Leaves do not bear hard ridged spines.

### Leaf sheath

Leaf base that forms a tubular sheath that encloses a length of stem below where the blade expands (e.g. in many grass species). This character has 2 states.

- #### Sheath absent

  Leaf that does not sheath the stem.

- #### Sheath present

  Leaf that sheathes the stem.

### Venation

The branching pattern of the veins of a leaf. This character has three states.

- #### Net-like/pinnate

  Leaf with a central prominent midvein with secondary (and sometimes tertiary) veins branching off from this central vein. Sometimes there may be more than one prominent vein, but these do not run parallel to one another.

- #### Parallel to mid-vein

  Leaf with two or more prominent veins that run parallel to each other for the length of the leaf.

- #### Venation indistinct

  Leaf without any clear venation except for a central midvein.

### Odor

- #### Aromatic

  Leaves with a strong, often sweet, spicy or malodorous scent (e.g. tea tree).

- #### Not aromatic

  Leaves that lack a strong odor.

### Stipules

Scale-like appendages at the base of the leaf stalk (petiole), usually occurring in pairs. Stipules may also be leafy or spinose. This character has four states.

- #### Stipules absent

  Stipules not present.

- #### Stipules scale-like

  These are typically only a few millimetres long. These may only be present on younger leaves (falling as leaves develop) or sometimes are appressed to the stem and difficult to see.

- #### Stipules leafy

  Stipules are green and ‘leafy’ sometimes appearing as a smaller version of the leaf they sit below.

- #### Stipules spinose

  Stipules that are modified into sharp, hardened spines. These usually occur as a pair of spines at the base of the leaf.

- #### Stipules minute/indistinct

  Stipules that are very small and often barely visible (e.g. a hand lens is needed to see them) or are shed by the plant very early on as the leaf develops, such that they are present but seldom seen.

### Ligule

- #### Ligule present

  Leaf with a membranous outgrowth or ring of hairs where it attaches to the stem.

- #### Ligule absent

  Leaf lacks a membranous outgrowth or ring of hairs where it attaches to the stem.

## Tendril

### Tendril position

- #### Tendrils absent

  Plants do not produce tendrils.

- #### Tendrils axillary/stipules

  Tendrils are produced from the base of the leaf where it attaches to the stem (axil), these usually represent modified stipules. Axillary tendrils will often persist on stems after the leaf has fallen.

- #### Tendrils terminal on branchlets

  Tendrils are produced from the tips of branchlets or at the end of at inflorescence.

- #### Tendrils formed on Leaves

  The tip of leaves or leaflets are modified into a tendril. Sometimes the petiole or rachis of some species with compound leaves can become tendril-like.  


## Inflorescence

The flower-bearing part of the plant, including flowers, bracts, and branches.

### Flower arrangement

The pattern in which flowers are arranged on a flowering stem. This character has six states.

- #### Single flowers

  Flowers that are not grouped with others on a stalk. Often these occur singly in a leaf axil or at the end of a branchlet.

- #### Small cluster

  Flowers are in groups of 2 to 5, often in a leaf axil, but do not form any specific pattern. These may derive from a shared stalk (peduncle) or each have their own stalk (pedicel) that attaches to the axis. In some instances, these may equally be treated as a very small umbel.

- #### Spike

  An unbranched inflorescence with numerous flowers which are sessile on the flowering stem. These can be quite long and sometimes have very densely-packed flowers such that the stalk (axis) is hidden by the flowers (e.g. Arum lily).

- #### Raceme/panicle/cyme

  A branched or unbranched inflorescence which has flowers on short stalks (pedicles) that are borne along a main (leafless) flowering stem.

- #### Umbel

  Inflorescence with all flower stalks (pedicles) arising from the same point on a common stalk (peduncle), and the flowers are displayed in an ‘umbrella shaped’ curved or flat-topped inflorescence.

- #### Head

  Short dense inflorescence with flowers radiating from a central point and appearing like a globular, cone-shaped or flat-topped head. Similar to umbel, but the individual flowers lack a distinct stalk (pedicel). These inflorescences may superficially appear to be a single flower.

### Flower stalk

Stalk subtending each individual flower (pedicel). This character has two states.

- #### Flowers stalked

  Flowers are immediately subtended by a (sometimes short) stalk (pedicel).

- #### Flowers sessile

  Flowers are not stalked, but borne directly in the leaf axil or on the stem. In some cases 2–many flowers may be sessile at the end of a common peduncle.

### Bracts

Modified leaf associated with flowers or at the base of branches in an inflorescence. These differ in shape, size or colour from other leaves, often being small, green and herbaceous. This character has two states.

- #### Bracts present

  Bract(s) (i.e. modified leaf associated with flowers or at the base of branches in an inflorescence, differing in shape, size or colour from other leaves) present.

- #### Bracts absent

  Bract(s) (modified leaf, differing in shape, size or colour from other leaves) absent.

### Bracteoles

Small bract borne singly or in pairs on the flower stalk (pedicel) or sepals (calyx). This character has 2 states.

- #### Bracteoles present

  Bracteole(s) present on the flower stalk (pedicel) or sepals (calyx).

- #### Bracteoles absent

  Bracteole(s) absent.

## Flower

### Flower type

The prominent structure or ‘showy’ part of the flower. This character has four states.

- #### Flowers petaloid

  Flowers with distinct petals which are usually brightly coloured or white (but usually not green).

- #### Flowers sepaloid

  Flowers that lack or have highly reduced petals and the prominent structure is the (usually herbaceous and green or brown) sepals or outer perianth whorl.

- #### Perianth minute or absent/bracteate

  Flowers lacking petals and sepals or these parts much reduced, often with bracts becoming the prominent part of the flower in place of the perianth (e.g. grasses, paper daisies etc.).

- #### Flowers staminate/stylar

  Flowers that have reduced or absent petals and sepals and the prominent/attractive structure is the stamens or styles (e.g. eucalypt flowers).

### Flower colour

The predominant colour of the flower (usually the colour of the petals). Where flowers are equally 2- (or more) coloured either colour may be entered. This character has eleven states.

### Flower sexuality

The fertile reproductive organs present in a single flower. This character has two states.

- #### Bisexual

  Both fertile male and female reproductive organs are present in a flower.

- #### Unisexual

  Fertile male and female reproductive organs are borne on separate flowers, either with both sexes present on the same plant – but different flowers (monoecious) or different plants (dioecious). In both cases, male and female flowers will often look quite distinct from one another.

### Flower symmetry

The relative size and shape of floral parts within each whorl of a flower and the number of planes of symmetry formed by these parts. This character has two states.

- #### Regular

  Flowers in which the perianth segments (petals and sepals) are alike within each whorl (e.g. petals are all the same size and shape), such that the flower has 2 or more planes of symmetry (actinomorphic or radially symmetrical).

- #### Irregular

  Flowers in which the perianth segments (petals and sepals) within each whorl vary in size and shape (zygomorphic), such that the flower is only symmetric along a single plane (i.e. there is a clear top and bottom to the flower).

### Hypanthium

Formed by the basal part of a flower giving rise to the floral parts (i.e. the receptacle or floral axis) and sometimes incorporating the floral parts, this may be enlarged and cup-shaped (Hypanthium). This character has two states.

- #### Prominent

  Flowers with an enlarged, often cup-shaped or tubular base formed by the receptacle and often surrounding the ovary or incorporating the perianth and stamens. Easily confused with flowers with tubular petals. Tubular petals are distinguished as petals because they may incorporate the stamens but do not include the receptacle. See petal/inner whorl fusion to indicate tubular petals.

- #### Inconspicuous

  Flowers that lack an enlarged cup-shaped or tubular base. These may have tubular petals, as long as the ’cup’ or ‘tube’ does not incorporate the receptacle. See petal/inner whorl fusion to indicate tubular petals.

### Number of perianth whorls

The number of whorls of sepals and petals (perianth) present on a flower. This is typically 2 – a sepal whorl and a petal whorl. However, one or both of these may be absent or there may be more than one petaloid or sepaloid whorl. This character has three states.

- #### 1 whorl

  Flowers with a single whorl of perianth that are similar in size, shape and colour (e.g. only petals or only sepals present).

- #### 2 or more whorls

  Flowers with two or more whorls of perianth, these may be dissimilar in size, shape and colour (e.g. both petals and sepals present), or similar in size, shape and colour, but with a distinct inner and outer whorl (e.g. Asphodelaceae).

- #### Perianth absent

  Flowers lack petals and sepals. Such flowers are often instead subtended and protected by bracts.

## Sepal

The sepals or outer whorl of non-fertile floral parts, these are often green and herbaceous, but also includes the outer whorl of flowers where all perianth whorls are colourful. These characters also relate to flowers with a single whorl of perianth that is green and sepal-like (i.e. lack colourful petals).

### Sepal number

The number of sepals or perianth parts in the outer whorl. These may appear as lobes or teeth when the parts are fused. This character has twelve states.

### Sepal fusion

The degree in which sepals or perianth parts in the outer whorl are fused together or free from one another. This character has three states.

- #### Sepals free

  Sepals (or outer perianth) free from one another, each individually attached to the receptacle.

- #### Sepals fused

- #### Petals fan-shaped/ligule

  Petals (or inner perianth) at least partially fused and the parts displayed on one side of the flower in a fan or strap shape (e.g. fan-flowers and the ligulate florets of daisies).

### Petal apex

The shape of the tip of the petals. This character has four states.

- #### Petal apex pointed

  Tips of petals come to an acute point.

- #### Petal apex rounded/flat

  Tips of petals are curved, rounded or flattened (truncate)

- #### Petal apex emarginate/lobed

  Tips of at least some petals have a shallow notch in the middle, or have multiple shallow notches/lobes along the apex of the petal.

- #### Petal apex bifid/deeply lobed

- #### Markings absent

  The inner surface of petals lack coverings or markings. Veins may be slightly darker or differently coloured to the rest of the petal surface.

- #### Petals with coloured markings

  The inner surface of petals has coloured streaks, spots etc. This does not include petals with veins that are darker or differently coloured to the rest of the petal surface.

- #### Petals with scales/lumps

  The inner surface of petals have raised lumps or scales that are the same or a different colour to the rest of the petal surface.

### Petal margins

Types (if any) of ornamentation along the margins of petals. This character has five states.

- #### Petal margins entire

  Petal margins lack any ornamentation or lobing.

- #### Petal margins winged

  Petal margins have a thin flange of tissue (often similar in colour and only slightly thinner than the petal lamina) extending beyond the central petal lamina. This character state does not refer to the ‘wing’ petals of pea flowers.

- #### Petal margins lobed/toothed

  Margins of petals that are lobed or toothed.

- #### Petal margins ciliate

  Margins of petals with numerous fine, often short hairs.

- #### Petal margins fringed

  Margins of petals with a fringe of long often colourful hair or the margins somewhat lacinate and tassel-like.

### Petal length

- #### Shorter to hardly exceeding sepals

  Petals (inner perianth whorls) do not or only shortly exceed the sepals (outer perianth whorl).

- #### Distinctly exceeding sepals

  Petals (inner perianth whorls) are distinctly longer than the sepals (outer perianth whorl).

### Corona

Large scales, long filaments or petal-like appendages attached to the petals, often attached at the junction of the floral tube and petal lobes. These sometimes are united to form a ring or ‘crown’ (corona) on the top of the flower (e.g. Daffodils). This character has two states.

- #### Corona present

  Petals with large scales, long filaments or petal-like appendages, often present at the junction of the floral tube and petal lobes.

- #### Corona absent

  Petals without large scales or petal-like appendages, often present at the junction of the floral tube and petal lobes.

## Male floral parts

The male reproductive organs of a flower i.e. stamens (androecium).

### Stamen number

The number of fertile stamens present on a flower. This character has eleven states.

### Stamen fusion

The way stamens are attached to the flower, they may individually attach to the receptacle (free) and be united to other stamens or other floral organs (or both). This character has five states.

- #### Stamens free

  Flowers with stamens not united together or to any other floral organs (e.g. petals).

- #### Stamens fused together

  Flowers with stamens fused together, often only the filaments are fused for part of their length, but the filaments may be entirely fused together to form a tube. Alternatively, the anthers may be fused together and the filaments free.

- #### Stamens fused to perianth

  Flowers with stamens fused to the petals or sepals (perianth). This may range from base of the stamen filament being fused to near the base of the perianth (and almost appearing free), to completely fused to the perianth with the anthers apparently borne directly on the perianth.

- #### Stamens fused together and to perianth

  Flowers with stamens both fused together and then fused to the perianth. This may involve the staminal filaments forming a tube and the stamen tube attaching to petals or the anthers forming a tube and the free filaments attached to the perianth.

- #### Stamens fused to carpel

  Flowers with the stamens (or stamen appendages) fused to the female reproductive structure (style or ovary) and often forming a column (e.g. Orchidaceae).

### Stamen arrangement

The arrangement of stamens relative to one another on the flower. This character has three states.

- #### Stamens regular (or 1)

  Flowers with stamens evenly spaced around the flower, or flowers with a single stamen.

- #### Stamens grouped in clusters

  Flowers with stamens grouped or fused into small clusters or bundles which are even spread around the flower (e.g. stamens in clusters of 3 opposite each petal).

- #### Stamens asymmetric

  Flowers with stamens borne or displayed asymmetrically e.g. all on one side of the flower. In some cases the anthers may appear spread around the ovary but the filaments all attach on one side of it e.g. some _Hibbertia_ species.

### Stamen vestiture

Hairs or appendages either associated with the anther or the filament. This character has two states.

- #### Stamens hairy/appendaged

  Stamens with a vestiture of hairs or appendages either associated with the anther or the filament. These are often formed at the base of the anther or junction of the filament and anther. Such appendages or hairs commonly play a role in pollen transfer or release by pollinators.

- #### Stamen vestiture absent

  Stamens lack obvious hairs or appendages (glabrous) or the stamens have a vestiture of minute hair that is visible only under magnification.

### Staminodes

Infertile male organs, often consisting only of a filament (with no or a highly reduced anther that does not produce pollen). These may occur on bisexual or unisexual (including female) flowers. This character has three states.

- #### Staminodes filament-like

  Flowers with staminodes that consist of a filament (or a structure resembling a filament) with or without a sterile anther.

- #### Staminodes petaloid

  Flowers with staminodes that are bright and colourful and petal-like, these may be quite distinct in size, shape and colour to the actual petals of the flower but do not look like the fertile stamens.

- #### Staminodes absent

  Flowers lack infertile stamens.

## Female Floral parts

The female reproductive organs of a flower i.e. ovary, style, stigma (gynoecium).

### Ovary position

The position of the ovary relative to other floral parts (i.e. sepals, petals, anthers, or if present the floral tube). This character has three states.

- #### Ovary superior

  Ovary is borne above the level of attachment of the other floral parts, or above the base of the floral tube (that is free from the ovary and bears the perianth and stamens).

- #### Ovary semi-inferior

  Ovary is partly above and partly below the level of attachment of the other floral parts (sepals, petals, stamens).

- #### Ovary inferior

  Ovary is entirely or almost entirely below the level of attachment of other floral parts (sepals, petals, stamens).

### Ovary number and fusion

The number of ovaries present on a flower and the degree to which carpels are fused i.e. partially fused carpels appear as a lobed ovary. This character has three states.

- #### >1 free ovaries

  Flowers with two or more (sometimes numerous) free ovaries.

- #### Ovary and carpels partially fused

  Flowers with an ovary with two or more partially fused carpels, such that it appears that there is more than one ovary (when only fused near the base) or that the ovary is lobed. Each ovary lobe may each have a terminal style, or there may be a single style rising from between the lobes.

- #### Single ovary

  Flowers with a single ovary, containing one or multiple fused carpels.

### Carpel number per ovary

The number of female reproductive units (carpels). This is usually evident by the number of chambers (locules) in the ovary. Flowers with more than one free ovary should only include the number of carpels in just one ovary. This character has eleven states.

### Style morphology

The shape and specialised structures formed by the style. This character has five states.

- #### Style simple/sessile

  Simple, unbranched style that consists of a stalk, or the style is much reduced or apparently lacking and the stigma is sessile on the ovary.

- #### Cup-shaped (indusium/pollen presenter)

  At least part of the style has been modified into a swollen, cup or saucer-shaped structure. This structure is generally used to hold and display pollen from the flower prior to the female structures becoming receptive (which occurs once the pollen has had a chance to disperse). Such structures are sometimes quite hairy.

- #### Style branched

  Style which branches into 2 or more arms. This may occur anywhere along the length of the style, from towards the base of the style, giving the appearance of several styles (see style number per ovary below for multiple free styles), or near the tip with each stigma sitting on a short branch.

- #### Style plumose

  Style with a feathery appearance with multiple fine side branches.

- #### Style petaloid

  Style relatively broad, thickened, herbaceous and colourful, appearing like a petal.

### Style number per ovary

The number of styles on an ovary. This character has eleven states.

## Fruit

### Fruit type

The type of structure that bears the seed(s). This character has ten states.

- #### Capsule

  Dry fruit usually with several chambers, opening when ripe via pores, slits, teeth, or splitting into pieces. Occasionally somewhat fleshy and similar to Single fleshy fruit (Berry/Drupe/Pome). Also easily confused with Follicle or Schizocarp, sometimes Capsules splitting into mericarps or Follicles (that secondarily release the seed, e.g. Malvaceae).

- #### Single fleshy fruit

  Indehiscent fleshy fruit formed by a single ovary, often firm externally with fleshy pulp inside (e.g. Berry/Drupe/Pome). Possibly confused with fleshy forms of Capsule, but differentiated from Capsule by being indehiscent.

- #### Aggregate of fused fleshy fruits

  Indehiscent fleshy fruit composed of multiple ovaries either from a single flower or several flowers that have fused together to form a single fruiting body (e.g. blackberry).

- #### Schizocarp

Dry fruit consisting of 2 or more segments that break apart into 1-seeded units (mericarps). Easily confused with capsule before seeds have begun to break up, and nut when mericarps are hard and nut-like.

- #### Cone

  A woody structure composed of accessory sructures (e.g. inflorescence axis and swollen bracts or bracteoles) and several individual fruits (e.g. a Cone with Samaras in Casuarinaceae and a Cone composed of Follicles in _Banksia_).

- #### Follicle

  Dry fruit sometimes woody (e.g. Proteaceae), with a single chamber, splitting along one side of the fruit. Often several developing from a single flower with multiple free or partially united ovaries (e.g Rutaceae and Crassulaceae). Easily confused with Pod/Legume/siliqua and capsule.

- #### Siliqua/pod

  Dry fruit with a single chamber (or two ‘false’ chambers separated thin membranous layer of tissue), externally splitting open along two sides. Often long and skinny ‘pea pods’. Easily confused with Follicle.

- #### Samara

  Dry, one-seeded indehiscent fruit with a winged seed wall. Easily confused with winged forms of Dry or spongy pericarp/utricle, but distinguished by the wing developing from the seed coat rather than the outer pericarp.

- #### Achene/cypsela/grain

  Dry one-seeded indehiscent fruit. Sometimes formed by flowers with multiple free ovaries, and hence appearing in dense heads (e.g. _Acaena novae-zelandiae_). Similar to Nut which has a very hard outer surface, and Samara which is winged.

- #### Nut

  Hard, dry one-seed indehiscent fruit (e.g. Acorn). Easily confused with Achene/cypsela/grain and Samara, which are similar but do not have a hard external coat, and Single fleshy fruit which often contain hard seeds ‘nuts’ within a fleshy fruit (e.g. Walnuts, Almonds etc.), but strictly speaking are drupes. Likewise some mericarps and Capsules can be very hard and sometimes incorrectly termed ‘nuts’ (e.g. Gumnuts).

- #### Dry or spongy pericarp/utricle

  Indehiscent, single seeded fruit concealed within a spongy, leafy or membranous outer layer. Sometimes this outer layer breaks apart or releases the seed. Easily confused with Single fleshy fruit (Berry/Drupe/Pome), but generally less fleshy. Also, the outer layer is composed of an enlarged pericarp (calyx, epicalyx or bracts) rather than the ovary tissue. May also be difficult to distinguish from nut when the outer coating is thin and closely attached to the seed coat (e.g. some species of Cyperaceae).

### Fruit colour

The colour of the fruiting body at maturity (ie. when ripe). Most fruit will initially be green, so this requires observation of mature fruit. This character has six states.

### Fruit Shape

The shape of fruit in cross section. This character has two states.

- #### Fruit round

  Includes shapes that have no clear angles, edges or ‘sides’ (e.g. oval and regularly or irregularly ellipsoid shapes). They may sometimes be somewhat flattened on the side where they attach to the fruiting stem, or have ridges or lobes.

- #### Fruit flattened/angular

  Shapes that have clear angles or ‘sides’ (e.g. triangle, quadrangle, rectangle, disc-shaped).

### Fruit division

Partial division of fruits into segments or lobes. This character has two states.

- #### Fruit lobed

  Fruits that are laterally lobed or bulging (e.g. a fruit that is partially divided into individual portions that are either basally or centrally attached)

- #### Fruit unlobed

  Fruit that are not segmented laterally. These may have terminal or basal lobes/lumps.

### Fruit margins

Ornamentation along the margin or edges of fruit. This character has two states.

- #### Fruit not winged

  Fruit lacking an extension beyond the normal outline of the fruit.

- #### Fruit winged/strongly ridged

  Fruit that have a thin flange, membranous expansion or thickened ridge extending beyond the normal outline of the fruit.

### Fruit spines

Hard rigid spines on the fruit. Such spines are generally sharp and painful to touch. This character has two states.

- #### Fruit spinose

  Fruit with covering of, or surrounded by stiff, hard or flexible, usually sharp spines.

- #### Fruit lacking spines

  Fruits without spines.

## Seed

### Seed margins

Ornamentation along the margin or edges of seed. This character has two states.

- #### Seed winged

  Seed that have a thin flange, membranous expansion extending beyond the normal outline of the seed.

- #### Seed not winged

  Seed lacking an extension beyond the normal outline of the seed, but may have minor ridges associated with the margins and faces.

### Aril

- #### Aril present

  Seed with an aril.

- #### Aril absent

  Seeds lacking a conspicuous aril.

### Seed hair

The presence of hair on seed surfaces (including non-shedding structures such as persistent mericarps). This does not include seeds with pappus – a row or rows of long hairs extending from the top of the seed, see ‘seed appendages’ below. This character has two states.

- #### Hairs present

  Seed with a covering or partial covering of hairs.

- #### Hairs absent

  Seed lacking hair.

### Seed surface

Texture or ornamentation on the seed surface. This character has 3 states.

- #### Smooth/wrinkled

  Seed with a smooth, more or less flat or slightly wrinkled surface.

- #### Ridged

  Seed with raised ridges (lines) that run either vertically or horizontally along the seed.

- #### Warty/pitted

  Seed with a lumpy surface due to the presence of raised wart-like protrusions or pitted (often circular) depressions.

### Seed appendages

The presence and placement of appendages such as awns, pappus, bristles or scales. These are structures usually associated with seed dispersal. These are distinguished from ‘seed hair’ which are usually covering or scattered across the seed surface. This character has four states.

- #### Appendages absent

  Seed lacking an appendage.

- #### Appendages terminal

  Seed with appendages such as an awn or row of bristles/scales at the top of the seed.

- #### Appendages lateral

  Seed with appendages, usually an awn or awns attached to the side of the seed.

- #### Appendages basal

  Seed with appendages, usually a ring of bristles or scales at the bottom of the seed (where the seed attaches to the fruit or fruiting receptacle).

## Occurrence

### Bioregion

Victoria has been divided into 16 natural regions. For this character the user determines which natural region the plant that is to be identified was found in to enter for this character. Whether a taxon is regarded as occurring in a particular natural region or not is dependent on whether the taxon has been previously documented as occurring in that natural region or not. There is a remote possible that a taxon occurs in a natural region but has not yet been documented in that natural region. In such a case the key will not recognise that taxon as occurring in that natural region which will result in a misidentification for the user. This issue may be particularly relevant to newly introduced species which may be still expanding their range through Victoria or for taxa that are under collected for herbaria. Due to these issues it is suggested that this character be one of the first characters investigated as a potential reason for misidentification.
